Multimedia Gesture Recognition


*Assumptions*

•	The directory dir for the data will have .csv files with multi-variate time-series data.

•	 The directory *dir* will be the location along with folder name. For example, the Folder Z has all the gesture files, 
so *dir* will be *<folder_path…\Z>*. In my case, *dir* input was *D:\ASU\Courses\MWDB\Project\Code\Z*


The System should be installed with Python 3.7.7.

*To Run the System:*
1.	Unzip the file.
2.	Open the folder Code in the command prompt
3.	Create virtual environment folder: python -m venv venv
4.	Activate the virtual environment: venv\Scripts\activate
5.	Install all the packages required: pip install -r requirements.txt
6.	Run the program file: python Phase1.py
7.	Follow along the interface.
